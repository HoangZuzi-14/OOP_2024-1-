Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to
build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructor methods for a class, as long as they have different parameters. 
This concept is called constructor overloading.
Each constructor must have a unique parameter list, either in terms of the number of parameters or the type of parameters.
